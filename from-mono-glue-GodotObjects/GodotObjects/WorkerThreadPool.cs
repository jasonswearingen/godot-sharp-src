/// <para>The <see cref="Godot.WorkerThreadPool"/> singleton allocates a set of <see cref="Godot.GodotThread"/>s (called worker threads) on project startup and provides methods for offloading tasks to them. This can be used for simple multithreading without having to create <see cref="Godot.GodotThread"/>s.</para>
/// <para>Tasks hold the <see cref="Godot.Callable"/> to be run by the threads. <see cref="Godot.WorkerThreadPool"/> can be used to create regular tasks, which will be taken by one worker thread, or group tasks, which can be distributed between multiple worker threads. Group tasks execute the <see cref="Godot.Callable"/> multiple times, which makes them useful for iterating over a lot of elements, such as the enemies in an arena.</para>
/// <para>Here's a sample on how to offload an expensive function to worker threads:</para>

/// 
/// private void ProcessEnemyAI(int enemyIndex)
/// {
///     Node processedEnemy = _enemies[enemyIndex];
///     // Expensive logic here.

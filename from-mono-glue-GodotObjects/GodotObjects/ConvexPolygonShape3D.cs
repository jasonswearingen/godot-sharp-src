/// <para>A 3D convex polyhedron shape, intended for use in physics. Usually used to provide a shape for a <see cref="Godot.CollisionShape3D"/>.</para>
/// <para><see cref="Godot.ConvexPolygonShape3D"/> is <i>solid</i>, which means it detects collisions from objects that are fully inside it, unlike <see cref="Godot.ConcavePolygonShape3D"/> which is hollow. This makes it more suitable for both detection and physics.</para>
/// <para><b>Convex decomposition:</b> A concave polyhedron can be split up into several convex polyhedra. This allows dynamic physics bodies to have complex concave collisions (at a performance cost) and can be achieved by using several <see cref="Godot.ConvexPolygonShape3D"/> nodes. To generate a convex decomposition from a mesh, select the <see cref="Godot.MeshInstance3D"/> node, go to the <b>Mesh</b> menu that appears above the viewport, and choose <b>Create Multiple Convex Collision Siblings</b>. Alternatively, <see cref="Godot.MeshInstance3D.CreateMultipleConvexCollisions(MeshConvexDecompositionSettings)"/> can be called in a script to perform this decomposition at run-time.</para>
/// <para><b>Performance:</b> <see cref="Godot.ConvexPolygonShape3D"/> is faster to check collisions against compared to <see cref="Godot.ConcavePolygonShape3D"/>, but it is slower than primitive collision shapes such as <see cref="Godot.SphereShape3D"/> and <see cref="Godot.BoxShape3D"/>. Its use should generally be limited to medium-sized objects that cannot have their collision accurately represented by primitive shapes.</para>

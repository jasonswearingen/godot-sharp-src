/// <para>A 2D polyline shape, intended for use in physics. Used internally in <see cref="Godot.CollisionPolygon2D"/> when it's in <see cref="Godot.CollisionPolygon2D.BuildModeEnum.Segments"/> mode.</para>
/// <para>Being just a collection of interconnected line segments, <see cref="Godot.ConcavePolygonShape2D"/> is the most freely configurable single 2D shape. It can be used to form polygons of any nature, or even shapes that don't enclose an area. However, <see cref="Godot.ConcavePolygonShape2D"/> is <i>hollow</i> even if the interconnected line segments do enclose an area, which often makes it unsuitable for physics or detection.</para>
/// <para><b>Note:</b> When used for collision, <see cref="Godot.ConcavePolygonShape2D"/> is intended to work with static <see cref="Godot.CollisionShape2D"/> nodes like <see cref="Godot.StaticBody2D"/> and will likely not behave well for <see cref="Godot.CharacterBody2D"/>s or <see cref="Godot.RigidBody2D"/>s in a mode other than Static.</para>
/// <para><b>Warning:</b> Physics bodies that are small have a chance to clip through this shape when moving fast. This happens because on one frame, the physics body may be on the "outside" of the shape, and on the next frame it may be "inside" it. <see cref="Godot.ConcavePolygonShape2D"/> is hollow, so it won't detect a collision.</para>
/// <para><b>Performance:</b> Due to its complexity, <see cref="Godot.ConcavePolygonShape2D"/> is the slowest 2D collision shape to check collisions against. Its use should generally be limited to level geometry. If the polyline is closed, <see cref="Godot.CollisionPolygon2D"/>'s <see cref="Godot.CollisionPolygon2D.BuildModeEnum.Solids"/> mode can be used, which decomposes the polygon into convex ones; see <see cref="Godot.ConvexPolygonShape2D"/>'s documentation for instructions.</para>

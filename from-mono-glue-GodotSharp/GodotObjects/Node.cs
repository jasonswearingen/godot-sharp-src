/// <summary>
/// <para>Nodes are Godot's building blocks. They can be assigned as the child of another node, resulting in a tree arrangement. A given node can contain any number of nodes as children with the requirement that all siblings (direct children of a node) should have unique names.</para>
/// <para>A tree of nodes is called a <i>scene</i>. Scenes can be saved to the disk and then instantiated into other scenes. This allows for very high flexibility in the architecture and data model of Godot projects.</para>
/// <para><b>Scene tree:</b> The <see cref="Godot.SceneTree"/> contains the active tree of nodes. When a node is added to the scene tree, it receives the <see cref="Godot.Node.NotificationEnterTree"/> notification and its <see cref="Godot.Node._EnterTree()"/> callback is triggered. Child nodes are always added <i>after</i> their parent node, i.e. the <see cref="Godot.Node._EnterTree()"/> callback of a parent node will be triggered before its child's.</para>
/// <para>Once all nodes have been added in the scene tree, they receive the <see cref="Godot.Node.NotificationReady"/> notification and their respective <see cref="Godot.Node._Ready()"/> callbacks are triggered. For groups of nodes, the <see cref="Godot.Node._Ready()"/> callback is called in reverse order, starting with the children and moving up to the parent nodes.</para>
/// <para>This means that when adding a node to the scene tree, the following order will be used for the callbacks: <see cref="Godot.Node._EnterTree()"/> of the parent, <see cref="Godot.Node._EnterTree()"/> of the children, <see cref="Godot.Node._Ready()"/> of the children and finally <see cref="Godot.Node._Ready()"/> of the parent (recursively for the entire scene tree).</para>
/// <para><b>Processing:</b> Nodes can override the "process" state, so that they receive a callback on each frame requesting them to process (do something). Normal processing (callback <see cref="Godot.Node._Process(double)"/>, toggled with <see cref="Godot.Node.SetProcess(bool)"/>) happens as fast as possible and is dependent on the frame rate, so the processing time <i>delta</i> (in seconds) is passed as an argument. Physics processing (callback <see cref="Godot.Node._PhysicsProcess(double)"/>, toggled with <see cref="Godot.Node.SetPhysicsProcess(bool)"/>) happens a fixed number of times per second (60 by default) and is useful for code related to the physics engine.</para>
/// <para>Nodes can also process input events. When present, the <see cref="Godot.Node._Input(InputEvent)"/> function will be called for each input that the program receives. In many cases, this can be overkill (unless used for simple projects), and the <see cref="Godot.Node._UnhandledInput(InputEvent)"/> function might be preferred; it is called when the input event was not handled by anyone else (typically, GUI <see cref="Godot.Control"/> nodes), ensuring that the node only receives the events that were meant for it.</para>
/// <para>To keep track of the scene hierarchy (especially when instantiating scenes into other scenes), an "owner" can be set for the node with the <see cref="Godot.Node.Owner"/> property. This keeps track of who instantiated what. This is mostly useful when writing editors and tools, though.</para>
/// <para>Finally, when a node is freed with <see cref="Godot.GodotObject.Free()"/> or <see cref="Godot.Node.QueueFree()"/>, it will also free all its children.</para>
/// <para><b>Groups:</b> Nodes can be added to as many groups as you want to be easy to manage, you could create groups like "enemies" or "collectables" for example, depending on your game. See <see cref="Godot.Node.AddToGroup(StringName, bool)"/>, <see cref="Godot.Node.IsInGroup(StringName)"/> and <see cref="Godot.Node.RemoveFromGroup(StringName)"/>. You can then retrieve all nodes in these groups, iterate them and even call methods on groups via the methods on <see cref="Godot.SceneTree"/>.</para>
/// <para><b>Networking with nodes:</b> After connecting to a server (or making one, see <see cref="Godot.ENetMultiplayerPeer"/>), it is possible to use the built-in RPC (remote procedure call) system to communicate over the network. By calling <see cref="Godot.Node.Rpc(StringName, Variant[])"/> with a method name, it will be called locally and in all connected peers (peers = clients and the server that accepts connections). To identify which node receives the RPC call, Godot will use its <see cref="Godot.NodePath"/> (make sure node names are the same on all peers). Also, take a look at the high-level networking tutorial and corresponding demos.</para>
/// <para><b>Note:</b> The <c>script</c> property is part of the <see cref="Godot.GodotObject"/> class, not <see cref="Godot.Node"/>. It isn't exposed like most properties but does have a setter and getter (see <see cref="Godot.GodotObject.SetScript(Variant)"/> and <see cref="Godot.GodotObject.GetScript()"/>).</para>
